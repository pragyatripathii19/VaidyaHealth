# 🩺 VaidyaHealth – Predicting Heart Failure Readmissions

**VaidyaHealth** is a machine learning-powered application developed by my team "VaidyaCoders" during the **Veersa Hackathon (Batch 2026)**. It predicts whether a heart failure patient is at risk of being readmitted within **30 days of discharge**.

The goal is to help healthcare providers take **timely preventive actions**, reduce **hospital readmission rates**, and improve **patient outcomes**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Heart failure is a serious condition that, if not managed properly, can lead to death. Even after treatment and discharge, many patients are readmitted within 30 days, which:

* ⚠️ Increases the risk of death (morbidity and mortality)
* 💸 Causes a financial burden on patients and families
* 🏥 Puts more pressure on already overloaded healthcare systems

### 🎯 Our Objective

Develop a **machine learning model** to:

> Predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge after treatment for heart failure.

This is a **binary classification** problem:

* `1` → Patient is **readmitted** within 30 days
* `0` → Patient is **not readmitted**

## 🗃️ Dataset Used

We worked with a subset of **8 tables** from the **MIMIC-III** public ICU dataset, shared via OneDrive.

We're expected to extract and merge relevant features from these tables to build an effective predictive model.
